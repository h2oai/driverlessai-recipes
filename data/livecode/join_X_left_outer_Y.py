# Livecode for joining 2 datasets, e.g.
# one dataset with transactions and another dataset has extended set of features.
# find location of the dataset file by going to DETAILS where it's displayed
# on top under dataset name

# Specification:
# Inputs:
#   X: datatable - primary dataset
#   Y_name: datatable - dataset to bind with
# Parameters:
#   join_key: string - column name to use as a key in join
# Output:
#   dataset containing all rows from both datasets
