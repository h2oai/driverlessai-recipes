# Compute aggregates with per-column expressions (means and sums in this example)
# for numeric (int, float) columns by groups.
# New frame contains computed aggregates of the columns and group by columns.

# Specification:
# Inputs:
#   X: datatable - primary data set
#   mean_columns: list of str - columns to compute means on (change to the aggregates and columns of your choice)
#   sum_columns: list of str - columns to compute sums on (change to the aggregates and columns of your choice)
# Parameters:
#   group_by_cols: list of column names - group columns to aggregate by
# Output:
#   dataset with computed aggregates and groups
